            <h3>Computer Vision</h3>
            <p>Computer vision is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to interpret and analyze visual information.</p>
            <p>Some features of AI in computer vision include:</p>
            <ol type=" ">
                <li><strong> Object detection</strong>: Computers can recognize multiple objects in an image and identify their location.</li> 
                <li><strong>Image segmentation</strong>: An image is divided into multiple segments to make it easier to analyze.</li> 
                <li><strong>Facial recognition</strong>: A system can identify or verify a person from a digital image or video.</li>
