            <li>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on creating machines and computers that can learn, reason, and act in ways that would normally require human intelligence.</li>
            <li>AI systems use data, algorithms, and computational power to learn from their experiences, make predictions, and automate processes.</li>
            <li>The idea of AI dates back thousands of years, when ancient philosophers considered questions about life and death. Inventors also created mechanical devices called "automatons" that could move independently.</li> 
            <li>In the early 21st century, the development of self-learning neural networks was a major advance in AI. By 2001, these networks were already performing better than humans in some areas, such as machine translation and object classification.</li>
